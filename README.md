# Typing Speed Test App

This is a Python practice project I developed to measure typing speed and accuracy.  
It provides a simple console-based interface where users can test how fast and accurately they type a given text.

## Features
- Displays random text for the user to type
- Calculates typing speed in **Words Per Minute (WPM)**
- Tracks typing accuracy by comparing input to the original text
- Simple and lightweight console-based design

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3**

## Purpose
This project was created as a **learning exercise** to practice:
- Python programming basics
- Working with time modules
- Handling string comparisons and user input

## Future Improvements
- Add a GUI (Tkinter or PyQt) for better user experience
- Include difficulty levels and leaderboard system
- Option to choose custom text passages
